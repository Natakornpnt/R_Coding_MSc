# R_Coding_MSc
R coding while I'm studying in master degree

such as Genomic Selection (GS) including machine learning (Cross-Validation test), 

Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS),

Calculating Heritability using lme4 package and Cullis function,

Data Visualization,

Data Transformation,

and others

This repository contains many R coding file
1. BLUP.R 

Best-Linear Unbiased Prediction transformation data using lme4 package

2. Cullis_H2.R

This code R was contain Cullis's heritability calculation function in R using variable from lme4 package

3. CRD_LSD_duncan.R

Anova statistic to find significant different

4. Endelman_Transformation.R

This code R is public which I downloaded and modified for my data to transform data followed by his manual

5. Single-trait_GS.R

This code R is obtained from Tong et al., 2020 published journal which I modified for my data for analyzed single trait GS using rrBLUP package.

6. Multi-trait-GS.R

This code R is obtained from Tong et al., 2020 published journal which I modified for my data for analyzed multi trait GS using sommer package.

7. Boxplot_GS_1kreps.R

This code R was used for visualized GS results as boxplot

8. GWAS_Code_modify.R

This code R was used for Genome-Wide Association Study and this code required some out sources which I uploaded in Source_GWAS_R folder

9. Manhattan_Plot.R

This code R was used for visualized GWAS results as manhattan plot, you can also modify treshold show in the graph.

10. correlation_heatmap.R

This code R was used for generate correlation matrix and visual the matrix as heatmap

11. linear_scatterplot.R and exponential_scatterplot.R

These R codes was use for analyze linear and exponential regression and in each code was contained modified plot for visualized the model.

12. histogram_loop.R

This code R was use for multiple histogram generate and save as png file
