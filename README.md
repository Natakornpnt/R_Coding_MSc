# R_Coding_MSc
R coding while I'm studying in master degree

such as Genomic Selection (GS) including machine learning (Cross-Validation test), 

Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS),

Calculating Heritability using lme4 package and Cullis function,

Data Visualization,

Data Transformation,

and others

This repository contains many R coding file

1. BLUP.R 

Best-Linear Unbiased Prediction transformation data using lme4 package.

2. Cullis_H2.R

This code R was contain Cullis's heritability calculation function in R using variable from lme4 package.

3. Endelman_Transformation.R

This code R is public which I downloaded and modified for my data to transform data followed by his manual.

# stat folder contain

1. linear_scatterplot.R 

These R codes was use for analyze linear regression and contained modified plot for visualized the model.

2. exponential_scatterplot.R

These R codes was use for analyze exponential regression and contained modified plot for visualized the model.

3. CRD_LSD_duncan.R

Anova statistic to find significant different.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# GS folder contain

1. Single-trait_GS.R

This code R is obtained from Tong et al., 2020 published journal which I modified for my data for analyzed single trait GS using rrBLUP package.

2. Multi-trait-GS.R

This code R is obtained from Tong et al., 2020 published journal which I modified for my data for analyzed multi trait GS using sommer package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# GWAS folder contain

1. Source_GWAS_R

Source code for performing Genome-Wide Association Study.

2. GWAS_Code_modify.R

This code R was used for Genome-Wide Association Study and this code required some out sources which I uploaded in Source_GWAS_R folder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# visualization folder contain

1. Boxplot_GS_1kreps.R

This code R was used for visualized GS results as boxplot.

2. Manhattan_Plot.R

This code R was used for visualized GWAS results as manhattan plot, you can also modify treshold show in the graph.

3. correlation_heatmap.R

This code R was used for generate correlation matrix and visual the matrix as heatmap.

4. histogram_loop.R

This code R was use for multiple histogram generate and save as png file.
